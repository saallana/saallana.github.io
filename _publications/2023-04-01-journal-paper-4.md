Scalability is an important feature for the long term adoption of a rating system that determines the privacy and security of Internet of Toys (IoToys). As technology evolves and innovations are introduced in the IoToy market, the rating system must be capable of including the impact of new factors in the overall safety of the toy. Similarly obsolete factors should be easily removable. The rating system should also account for the difference in the weightage of individual factors. This research enhances the ChildShield rating system proposed by Allana & Chawla (2021) to reflect these additional features. The corresponding consumer label is expanded to include a secondary layer to present supplementary details to the consumer during purchase and use. A case study of grading an IoToy with the enhanced system is conducted in collaboration with a manufacturer and the steps for rating and labelling of IoToys using self-evaluation and guided modes are proposed.
