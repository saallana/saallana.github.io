Privacy attacks on machine learning (ML) models pose significant risks to individuals whose personal data is used for training or querying these models. Although concerns about the potential exposure of sensitive information through ML models continue to grow, existing safeguard mechanisms primarily focus on security threats, often neglecting privacy risks. In this paper, we examine existing tools to assess the robustness of ML models and provide an overview of various privacy attacks and defense strategies. Given the lack of a comprehensive framework for assessing privacy vulnerabilities, we propose a unified framework for evaluating the privacy of ML systems and establish a set of tailored evaluation metrics for different types of privacy attacks. In addition, we develop a dedicated testbed to implement our framework and present experimental results that demonstrate the impact of various privacy attacks on different ML models.
