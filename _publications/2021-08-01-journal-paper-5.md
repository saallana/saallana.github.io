The wave of IoT has spread across the toy market providing designers opportunities for bringing innovation into children’s play in the form of toys that can adapt, connect and communicate referred to as Internet of Toys (IoToys). Research and media reports have underscored the potential misuse by threat actors for surveillance, theft of children’s personal information, opening a covert channel of communication with children and influencing their thoughts and actions. Currently there is a lack of standard labelling system for internet safety of toys that makes it difficult for parents to make the right choice while purchasing. Consumer awareness is critical in this area because of the vulnerability of children, who are the ultimate users. This research identifies the factors affecting privacy and security of IoToys and proposes a methodology for evaluation of toys based on these factors. ChildShield, a privacy and security label, has been recommended as a communication tool between toy manufacturers and consumers.
