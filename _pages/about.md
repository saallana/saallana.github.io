I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Data Management and Privacy Governance Lab, [School of Computer Science](https://www.uoguelph.ca/computing/), University of Guelph. My supervisor is [Dr. Rozita Dara](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?hl=en&user=s4UEQXkAAAAJ), Associate Professor and Assistant Director, School of Computer Science, University of Guelph. My current area of research is the intersection of privacy and explainability. 

I am strongly interested in the ethical aspects of technology and its impact on society. Prior to commencing my doctoral studies, I worked on a research project called [ChildShield](https://saallana.github.io/childshield). This is a privacy and security label for internet connected toys. It provides a safety rating for children's toys and can be released by manufacturers to inform parents and guardians about the privacy and security compliance of toys. The press release can be found [here](https://www.jcu.edu.au/news/releases/2020/october/toy-report-card-for-internet-safety).

Previously, I have worked in the industry as a software engineer and project lead. I have also taught undergraduate and graduate courses in Computer Science across institutions in Singapore.
