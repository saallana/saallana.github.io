I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Data Management and Privacy Governance Lab, [School of Computer Science](https://www.uoguelph.ca/computing/), University of Guelph. My supervisor is [Dr. Rozita Dara](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?hl=en&user=s4UEQXkAAAAJ), Associate Professor and Assistant Director, School of Computer Science, University of Guelph.

My current area of research is the intersection of privacy and explainability. Prior to commencing my doctoral studies, I worked on a project called [ChildShield](https://saallana.github.io/childshield). This is a privacy and security label for internet connected toys. 

I have worked in the industry as a software engineer and project lead. I have also taught undergraduate and graduate courses in Computer Science across institutions in Singapore.
